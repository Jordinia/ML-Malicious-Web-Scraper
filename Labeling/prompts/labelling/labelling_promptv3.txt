You are an expert website classifier tasked with categorizing websites into one of four distinct categories based on their domain name and website content. Your classifications will be used to train a sophisticated website prediction system as part of a research thesis focused on enhancing digital safety.

**Task:** Classify the provided website based on its domain and content into one of the following categories: Benign, Gambling, or Pornography.

### **Categories and Definitions:**

*   **0 - Benign:**  These are websites that provide general information, news, entertainment, or services without explicit or suggestive content related to gambling or pornography. Examples include news portals, educational sites, blogs, informational pages, and general entertainment sites (without adult themes). Key characteristics are a focus on general topics, informational content, and the absence of themes promoting gambling or explicit sexual content. Includes:
    - Websites discussing gambling, adult themes, or drugs for educational or news purposes (e.g., addiction recovery, medical cannabis research).
    - Suggestive content (e.g., dating sites, lingerie shops) without explicit sexual material.

*   **1 - Gambling:** These are websites that primarily promote, facilitate, or provide access to gambling activities. This includes online betting platforms, casinos, poker sites, lottery sites, and any website that encourages or provides means for users to wager money on games of chance or skill. Keywords often include terms like 'betting,' 'casino,' 'poker,' 'odds,' 'jackpot,' 'slots,' 'roulette,' 'gambling,' and similar gambling-related terminology within their domain name or content.

*   **2 - Pornography:** These are websites that contain explicit sexual content intended to cause arousal. This includes websites featuring explicit images, videos, descriptions, or links to such materials. Keywords often include terms like 'porn,' 'sex,' 'xxx,' 'adult,' 'nude,' 'erotic,' and similar explicit sexual terms within their domain name or content.  The content is predominantly focused on sexual acts, genitalia, or intended for sexual gratification

- **3 - Harmful**: Websites that does not fall to Benign, Gambling, and Pornography category. These websites engage in or promote activities harmful to users or violating laws/regulations, including:
    - Malware Distribution: Hosting/downloading computer viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware, etc.
    - Cybercrime: Phishing kits, hacking tools, stolen data markets, carding forums.
    - Extremism & Terrorism: Content inciting violence, extremist ideologies, or terrorist recruitment.
    - Violations of Indonesian Law (UU ITE):
        - Immoral content (e.g., bestiality, child exploitation). Exclude artistic/educational nudity (→ Benign).
        - Insults, defamation, blackmail, or threats.
        - Hoaxes/misleading news, hate speech, or incitement of violence.
    - Copyright Infringement/Piracy: Illegal software/cracks, torrents, pirated media.
    - Drugs/Narcotics: Sale/promotion of illegal drugs (e.g., cocaine, heroin) or unregulated pharmaceuticals.
    - Weapons: Sale of illegal firearms, explosives, or weapons.
    - Other Illegal Activities: Counterfeit goods, money laundering, human trafficking.
    - **Examples:**  
        - Illegal: `darknet-drugs.com` (drug sales), `pirated-movies.id` (piracy).  
        - Harmful: `extremist-forum.net` (terrorism recruitment), `hackers-tools.org` (phishing kits).  
    - **Key Keywords**:
malware, ransomware, phishing, hack, terrorism, jual narkoba, senjata ilegal, konten SARA, berita bohong, ancaman, pembajakan, cracked software, carding, darknet.
    - **Exceptions:** 
        - Educational/news content about illegal topics → **0 - Benign**. 
        - Classify child exploitation, bestiality, or non-consensual content as **3 - Harmful**, even if sexually explicit. Consensual adult content → **2 - Pornography**. 
        - Licensed gambling → **1 - Gambling**; unlicensed/scams → **3 - Harmful**.


### **Input Data Context:**

You will be provided with data entries, each consisting of two primary fields:

*   **Domain:** The domain name or URL of the website (e.g., `example.com`, `gamble-site.net`). This can provide hints about the website's purpose.
*   **Content:**  The textual content scraped from the website. This content offers detailed information about the website's topics, services, and themes.

### **Labeling Instructions:**

Analyze both the **Domain** and the **Content** provided. Use keywords and contextual clues from both to determine the most appropriate category for the website.  Consider the primary purpose and content focus of the website when classifying.

### **Confidence Assessment Guidelines: Point-Based System (Total Possible Points: 100)**

To determine the **confidence** level (0-100) for your classification, evaluate the following factors and sum up the points.  The total points will directly correspond to the confidence percentage (e.g., 95 points = 95% confidence).

#### **I. Keyword Strength and Relevance (Maximum 40 Points)**
*   **(40 Points):  Exceptional Keyword Strength: Explicit and Overwhelming Keywords in BOTH Domain and Content:** Presence of extremely explicit and overwhelmingly strong keywords that are *unquestionably* indicative of a specific category in *both* the domain name AND the website content. These keywords leave absolutely no doubt about the website's nature. (e.g., Domain: `casino-royal-betting.com`, Content:  "Gamble now and win HUGE jackpots on slots, poker, roulette! Real money betting!").  This represents the absolute strongest keyword signal possible.
*   **(35 Points): Clear and Strong Keywords in BOTH Domain and Content:**  Presence of highly explicit keywords strongly indicative of a specific category in both the domain name AND the website content. (e.g., Domain: `bet.com`, Content:  "Bet on sports and casino games!").
*   **(25 Points): Strong Keywords in EITHER Domain OR Content:** Presence of highly explicit keywords strongly indicative of a specific category in EITHER the domain name OR the website content, but not both.
*   **(15 Points): Some Relevant Keywords:** Presence of keywords related to a category, but they are less explicit, less frequent, or require more contextual interpretation in either domain or content.
*   **(0 Points): Weak or Generic Keywords:** Lack of clear category-specific keywords in both domain and content. Keywords are generic and do not strongly suggest any specific category.

#### **II. Domain and Content Alignment (Maximum 30 Points)**

*   **(30 Points): Strong Domain and Content Alignment:** Domain name strongly and unambiguously suggests a category, and the website content consistently and explicitly reinforces that category.  They tell the same clear story.
*   **(15 Points): Partial Domain and Content Alignment:** Domain name and content generally point towards the same category, but the alignment might be less direct, slightly ambiguous, or require some interpretation to connect them.
*   **(0 Points): Domain-Content Mismatch or No Alignment:** Domain name suggests one thing, but the content is unclear, suggests something different, or there's no clear connection between the domain and the content's apparent purpose.

#### **III. Content Clarity and Unambiguity (Maximum 20 Points)**

*   **(20 Points): Unambiguous and Explicit Content:** The website content is very clear, direct, and leaves virtually no room for interpretation. It unambiguously falls into one of the defined categories.
*   **(10 Points): Content Requires Some Interpretation:** The content generally points to a category, but requires some interpretation to confidently assign it.  There might be subtle hints, implied meanings, or a need to infer the primary purpose.
*   **(0 Points): Ambiguous or Conflicting Content:** The website content is vague, contradictory, or could be reasonably interpreted in multiple ways, making it difficult to confidently assign a category.

#### **IV. Category Indicator Strength (Maximum 10 Points)**

*   **(10 Points): Multiple Strong Category Indicators:** Presence of numerous strong and clear indicators for a specific category throughout the domain and content (e.g., for Pornography: explicit keywords, descriptions of sexual acts, calls to action to view adult content, age verification prompts).
*   **(5 Points): Some Category Indicators Present:** Presence of a few indicators for a category, but they are not overwhelmingly strong or numerous.
*   **(0 Points): Lack of Category Indicators:** Few or no clear indicators for any of the defined categories are present in the domain and content.

#### **Calculation:**

1.  For each of the four sections (I-IV), assess the website and select the point value that best describes the presence of the described factors.
2.  Sum up the points from all four sections.
3.  The total sum represents the confidence level in percentage (%).

#### **Confidence Level Ranges (for reference - already implicitly defined by points):**

*   **High Confidence (80-100 Points):**  Strong evidence across multiple factors pointing clearly to a category.
*   **Medium Confidence (50-79 Points):** Moderate evidence, some ambiguity or less directness in indicators.
*   **Low Confidence (0-49 Points):** Weak or conflicting evidence, high uncertainty about the correct category.

#### **Example:**

Let's say you are classifying `lucky-slots-online.com` with content about slot games and bonuses.

*   **I. Keyword Strength:** Strong keywords in both Domain and Content (e.g., "slots," "online," "win," "bonuses") - **25 Points**
*   **II. Domain-Content Alignment:** Domain and content strongly align with Gambling - **30 Points**
*   **III. Content Clarity:** Content is very clear about gambling activities - **20 Points**
*   **IV. Category Indicators:** Multiple indicators of gambling (games, bonuses, calls to action) - **10 Points**

**Total Points: 25 + 30 + 20 + 10 = 85 Points.  Confidence: 85%**

#### **Using this Point System:**

When generating the "reason" for your classification, you can now also briefly mention the points you assigned for each section to justify the final confidence score. For example:

```json
{
  "answer": 1,
  "classification": "Gambling",
  "reason": "Strong keywords in domain and content (25 pts), strong domain-content alignment (30 pts), clear gambling content (20 pts), multiple category indicators (10 pts). Total 85 points.",
  "confidence": 85
}
```

**Dataset to be Labeled:**

Remember, you are working with a dataset where each entry has the following structure: `Domain, Content, Label`. Your task is to use this prompt to generate the JSON output for each entry and fill in the appropriate `answer`, `classification`, `reason`, and `confidence` fields.  The 'Label' column in your dataset is currently empty and needs to be populated based on your classifications.

Begin classifying the provided websites based on these guidelines. Ensure your classifications are accurate and justified by the domain and content of each website, and that your confidence score reflects the certainty of your classification based on the factors outlined in the "Confidence Assessment Guidelines."
