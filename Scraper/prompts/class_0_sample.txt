Britain's prime minister has requested an investigation into the abuse and intimidation of parliamentary candidates in last month's election.
Theresa May asked the Committee on Standards in Public Life to review a rising number of reports from members of all political parties of sexism, racism and anti-Semitism.
A report from the All Party Parliamentary Group on Antisemitism found many candidates in Britain's 2017 general election received death threats and abuse online.
May said Wednesday that she was ""horrified"" by the intimidation and harassment of her colleagues.
""Robust debate is a vital part of our democracy, but there can be no place for the shocking threats and abuse we have seen in recent months,"" she said.
The committee will examine existing protections for political candidates and recommend changes.

For now, debate of the legislation has been postponed . Organisers say one million people turned out for the protests, while police estimate the number was around 240,000. Either way, it was a significant number of Hong Kong’s 7.5 million population. Commentators on Twitter remarked on how well organised the protesters were. So, how did they do it? Protesters across the world are using n

Former FARC guerrilla, Colombian cop pose naked together to promote peace deal
By peacemaker - November 22, 2015
There are very few There are very few countries in the world where the advancement of peace talks to end a decades old civil conflict leads two gorgeous women to strip naked and canoodle for a sexy magazine shoot. Israel and Palestine? Don't think so. North and South Korea? Wouldn't bet on it. Ukraine? Possibly, but not likely. Colombia, however... absolutely! With major breakthroughs occurring in the long-running peace talks between the Colombian government and the Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group, a former member of Colombia's version of the FBI and a former guerrilla decided to give peace – and nude modelling – a chance. That's how Isabel Londono, a former member of Colombia's now defunct national intelligence agency DAS, ending up wearing a skimpy black bra and panties as a nude Ana Pacheco, an ex-FARC guerrilla, nestles up next to her for the cover shot of Soho, a Colombian men's magazine.
